# Code Refactor Starter Code

For this project, I refracted the code for the Horiseon website so that it follows accessibilty standards and improves optimization for search engines.

I made the following changes to the code: 
1. Add semantic elements 
2. Add alt attributes to the images
3. Add a concise title
4. Dry up CSS classes for less redundancy
5. Add comments

The following is a screenshot of the final draft of the project:
